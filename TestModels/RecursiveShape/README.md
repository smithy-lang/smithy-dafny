# RecursiveShape

This project implements the smithy [SimpleTypes](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/simple-types.html) into a recursive shaped structure along with the associated operations in `dafny`. This is then transpiled to a target runtime, and each tests are executed - either as CI actions or manually.

## Build

### .NET

1. Generate the Wrappers using `polymorph`

```
make polymorph_dotnet
```

2. Transpile the tests (and implementation) to the target runtime.

```
make transpile_net
```

3. Generate the executable in the .NET and execute the tests

```
make test_net
```

## Development

1. To add another target runtime support, edit the `Makefile` and add the appropriate recipe to generate the `polymorph` wrappers, and dafny transpilation.
2. Provide any glue code between dafny and target runtime if required.
3. Build, execute, and test in the target runtime.

_Example_

`--output-dotnet <PATH>` in the `gradlew run` is used to generate the polymorph wrappers. Similarly `--compileTarget:<RUNTIME>` flags is used in dafny recipe to transpile to C#.
