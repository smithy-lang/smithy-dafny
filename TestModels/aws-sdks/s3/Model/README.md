This is a manually-generated subset the Amazon S3 Smithy model.

It includes the AmazonS3 service, and the following operations:

- DeleteObject
- DeleteObjects
- GetObject
- PutObject

and the consituent Request/Output shapes, and the transitive closure of their members.

Ideally, this would be accomplished using Smithy Projections, but the S3 model is extremely complicated, and crafting a selector which produces this valid subset is more work than just copying the shapes manually.
