//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by SimpleService. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling SimpleService.
///
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A `Client` requires a config in order to be constructed. With the default set of Cargo features,
/// this config will only require an endpoint to produce a functioning client. However, some Smithy
/// features will require additional configuration. For example, `@auth` requires some kind of identity
/// or identity resolver to be configured. The config is used to customize various aspects of the client,
/// such as:
///
///   - [HTTP Connector](crate::config::Builder::http_connector)
///   - [Retry](crate::config::Builder::retry_config)
///   - [Timeouts](crate::config::Builder::timeout_config)
///   - [... and more](crate::config::Builder)
///
/// Below is a minimal example of how to create a client:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// let config = simple::Config::builder()
///     .endpoint_url("http://localhost:1234")
///     .build();
/// let client = simple::Client::from_conf(config);
/// ```
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should be done
/// once at application start-up. Cloning a client is cheap (it's just an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc) under the hood),
/// so creating it once at start-up and cloning it around the application as needed is recommended.
